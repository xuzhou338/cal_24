# cal_24
A fun "calculate 24" game. You have 4 random numbers from 1 to 13 and you have
 to use +,-,*,/ and () to get a result of 24.

Note: You need to use all 4 numbers.

Just download all and run cal_24.py (shell-based) or cal_24_gui.py (GUI). It
will show a question and a set of solution at a time. Will add more "game"
functionalities later.
